# JuliaKernel

**JuliaKernel** is a modular execution framework for secure, permissioned AI agents on Web3. Inspired by the original JuliaKernel, this .NET version focuses on building a robust WASM-based sandbox for agent execution, plugin-based extensibility, and multi-chain compatibility.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

JuliaKernel enables developers to create autonomous agents that operate across blockchain networks securely and transparently. Each agent runs inside a WebAssembly (WASM) sandbox, governed by a manifest-based permission system, and interacts with onchain resources via modular plugins.

## ðŸ§¹ Key Concepts

- **WASM Isolation**  
  Each agent runs in its own WebAssembly sandbox. No shared memory or global I/O is allowed.

- **Manifest-First Execution**  
  All permissions and capabilities are declared in a `manifest.yaml` file. No undeclared actions are allowed at runtime.

- **Modular Plugin Architecture**  
  Agent capabilities (like sending transactions, voting, or querying) are implemented via permissioned plugins.

- **Multi-Chain Ready**  
  Supports EVM chains (Base, Optimism, Ethereum), with adapters planned for Solana and Cosmos chains.

---

## ðŸ”§ Example Workflow

1. Write your agent logic in Rust or AssemblyScript and compile to WASM.
2. Define `manifest.yaml` to declare permissions and rate limits.
3. Add necessary plugins like `tx_executor` or `chain_query`.
4. Deploy using CLI:
   ```bash
   juliakernel run meme_sniper
   ```
